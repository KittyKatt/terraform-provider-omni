# Omni Provider

This provider is used for interacting with SideroLabs' SaaS or self-hosted Kubernetes
cluster orchestration tool, Omni.

This provider depends on Talos machines being created in some fashion outside of
its logic and being linked with the Omni instance you're connecting the provider to.
The Service Account should have the correct permissions to create and administrate
clusters, as well.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Can also be provided with environment variable OMNI_ENDPOINT
variable "omni_uri" {
  type = string
}

# Can also be provided with environment variable OMNI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY
variable "omni_service_account_key" {
  type = string
}

provider "omni" {
  endpoint            = var.omni_uri
  service_account_key = var.omni_service_account_key
}
```

## Provider Configuration

## Schema

### Optional

- `endpoint` (String) URL for the Omni API endpoint. May also be provided via the OMNI_ENDPOINT environment variable.
- `service_account_key` (String, Sensitive) Service account key for Omni. This is used to authenticate requests to the Omni API. May also be provided via the OMNI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY environment variable.

## Limitations

Currently, the only supported method of authenticating to an Omni instance in this
provider is through a Service Account key.
