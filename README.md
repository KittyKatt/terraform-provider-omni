# Terraform Provider - Omni

This is a very unofficial and very, VERY pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha provider for interacting with SideroLabs' Omni Kubernetes cluster
orchestration tool. There's a lot in flux here, so don't expect any kind of stability or bug-free experience at the moment.

Also, this project was my "I kinda wanna learn golang while also learning how to effectively use GH Copilot", so take everything here
as extreme entry-level dev quality. I'm by no means a golang dev (I'm barely a dev at all), so please be kind. If you see improvements,
I'm more than happy to get PRs and discuss what I could be doing better.
